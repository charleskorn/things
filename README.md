# things
Some things I've designed for 3D printing. 

Not all of these are finished, perfect designs, so you might need to tweak them to suit your needs.

## How to use
Each thing has a directory containing:
* the [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) source file, suitable for editing
* an exported STL file, suitable for use with 3D printing software

## OpenSCAD resources
Some pages I find useful:
* [the OpenSCAD cheat sheet](http://www.openscad.org/cheatsheet/index.html)

(more coming soon)
