A cover for the [Apple Wireless Keyboard](http://www.apple.com/keyboard/)'s power button, to help prevent your keyboard turning on accidentally while in a bag, backpack etc. It also doubles as a tool to open and close the cover on the battery compartment.

It should also be compatible with the [Apple Magic Trackpad](http://www.apple.com/magictrackpad/).
